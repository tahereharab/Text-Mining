# Event-based User Profiling in Social Media Using Data Mining Approaches

Social Networks have undergone a dramatic growth and influenced everyoneâ€™s life in
recent years. People share everything from daily life stories to the latest local and
global news and events using social media. This rich and continuous flow of usergenerated 
content has received significant attention from many organizations and researchers and 
is increasingly becoming a primary source for social and marketing researches to name a few. 
Accordingly, a great number of works have been conducted to extract valuable information 
from different platforms. However, there are no specific studies that focus on categorizing 
social media users based on the texts they share about a specific event. Given that the 
identification of online users with common interest in a particular event can help event 
organizers to attract more visitors to future similar events; 
This work study concentrates on examining the similarity between such users from the aspect 
of textual published contents. In this work different approaches have been proposed and 
various experiments have been carried out to support an explanation concerning this notion. 
We take a systematic approach to accomplish this objective by applying topic modeling techniques, 
using statistical and data mining algorithms, combined with information visualization.
